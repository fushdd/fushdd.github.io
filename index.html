            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <section> <!--content inside of the <section> elements will have specific background color-->
                <p>I am a 17-year-old student at Humber Polytechnic. I was born in a small city of Russia, Ufa, and moved to Moscow when I turned 11.</p>
                <p>Since that moment I was very interested in Computer Science, took a couple of programming courses and really got into it. The only programming language I studied was Python (and I was pretty worried about that fact), but now I'm starting to think that all the languages are quite similar.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            
            <section> <!--content inside of the <section> elements will have specific background color-->
                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>My main interest is video games.</p>
                <p>My favorite ones that I've played lately are:</p>
                <ul> <!--unordered list-->
                    <li>Dota 2</li>
                    <li>Elden Ring</li>
                    <li>Dead by Daylight</li>
                    <li>Haste</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I don't really like competitive games, but these are the only games that can be played with friends for a long time (and playing with friends is much more fun!)</p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>Listening to music might even take up more time than games. In 2024 I spent 71,513 minutes (~ 1200 hours) listening to music!</p>
                <p>I listen to many different genres of music:</p>
                <ul> <!--unordered list-->
                    <li>Pop (Lady Gaga, The Weeknd, bbno$, JAWNY)</li>
                    <li>K-Pop (TWICE, BLACKPINK, KATSEYE)</li>
                    <li>Rap (Eminem, Logic, BlabberMouf)</li>
                    <li>Rock (Limp Bizkit, Mindless Self Indulgence, Disturbed, I Prevail)</li>
                </ul>
